A Twitter widget that is easy to configure and easy to style.

== Description ==

A Twitter widget that is easy to configure and easy to style. It uses the Embedded Timeline widget of Twitter.com.
You can have it load an extra stylesheet, where you can style the layout of the widget.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to [Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-timelines).
4. Create your own Embedded Timeline App.
5. Go to Appearance->Widgets, add the widget to any sidebar.
6. Add your Twitter Name and your Twitter ID from the code you got from Twitter.
7. Enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I edit the stylesheet? =

Copy the style_twitter.css from the plugin to your theme directory.
The widget will find it and add it to the webpage instead of the default in the plugin.
Do not edit the style_twitter.css in the plugin itself, it will be overwritten when updating.

= Can I add multiple widgets to a page? =

You can, but it will probably not load any styling in the second widget.
